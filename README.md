# HandwrittenDigitRecognition-Scikit-learn

Handwritten digits are images in the form of 28*28 gray scale intensities of images representing an image along with the first column to be a label (0 to 9) for every image. Our goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

Hypothesis to be tested : The Digits data set of scikit-learn library is claimed to be accurate 95% of the time.
In this project, we are going to work with the digit dataset from scikit-learn and analyse the above hypothesis
